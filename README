PROGRAM STRUCTURE:

My program is all done in the cpp file the H file only has the declarations.

Main only calls one function which then calls check function that checks
the user's input and then the check function calls the appropriate function from
the Manager class.

The Manager class goes on to call functions from the base class employee where the defenitions
of each function lies.

PROGRAM FUCNTIONALITY:

The program uses linked lists to: 
1. hire a new employee (by adding a new node to the end of list). 
2. promote/demote an employee (by changing the level variable in node).
3. dismiss an employee (by deallocating appropriate node). 
4. lookup an employee's level (by finding employee name and printing level). 
5. display all employees at a specific level (by checking if level is appropriate then displaying all employees at level).  
6. assign a new mentor to an employee (searches for appropriate employee name then assigns mentor to the variable in node).  
7. terminate a mentor/mentee pair (searches for employee name then removes mentor). 
8. lookup mentoring information for a specific employee (searches for employee name then prints mentor).  
9. display all current mentoring pairs (goes through list then checks if each employee has a mentor if they do it prints the mentor).
10. exit the program (checks if user picked option 10 if so exits).

HOW TO RUN IT:

First choose option 1 to hire an employee then you could do as you wish 
after you have at least one employee hired.

Make sure that the level is one word with no spaces.
